// Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern controls which packages are
// upgraded.
//
// Lines below have the format format is "keyword=value,...".  A
// package will be upgraded only if the values in its metadata match
// all the supplied keywords in a line.  (In other words, omitted
// keywords are wild cards.) The keywords originate from the Release
// file, but several aliases are accepted.  The accepted keywords are:
//   a,archive,suite (eg, "stable")
//   c,component     (eg, "main", "crontrib", "non-free")
//   l,label         (eg, "Debian", "Debian-Security")
//   o,origin        (eg, "Debian", "Unofficial Multimedia Packages")
//   n,codename      (eg, "jessie", "jessie-updates")
//     site          (eg, "http.debian.net")
// The available values on the system are printed by the command
// "apt-cache policy", and can be debugged by running
// "unattended-upgrades -d" and looking at the log file.
//
// Within lines unattended-upgrades allows 2 macros whose values are
// derived from /etc/debian_version:
//   ${distro_id}            Installed origin.
//   ${distro_codename}      Installed codename (eg, "jessie")
        // Codename based matching:
        // This will follow the migration of a release through different
        // archives (e.g. from testing to stable and later oldstable).
//      "o=Debian,n=jessie";
//      "o=Debian,n=jessie-updates";
//      "o=Debian,n=jessie-proposed-updates";
//      "o=Debian,n=jessie,l=Debian-Security";

# --force-confold: 
#        do not modify the current configuration file, the new version is installed with a 
#        .dpkg-dist suffix. With this option alone, even configuration files that you have 
#        not modified are left untouched. You need to combine it with --force-confdef to let 
#        dpkg overwrite configuration files that you have not modified.
#        
# --force-confnew: always install the new version of the configuration file, the current version
#        is kept in a file with the .dpkg-old suffix.
#        
# --force-confdef: 
#        ask dpkg to decide alone when it can and prompt otherwise. 
#        This is the default behavior of dpkg and this option is mainly useful 
#        in combination with --force-confold.
#        
# --force-confmiss: ask dpkg to install the configuration file if it’s currently missing 
#        (for example because you have removed the file by mistake).
