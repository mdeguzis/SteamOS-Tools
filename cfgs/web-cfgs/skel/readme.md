# Banner image searching
In a Google Image search, click the "Search Tools" tab and set the search size to 
exactly 460x215. This is the standard size for Steam images and you will be able 
to search for specific grid images much easier.

# Default user config folder

The folder "Default" is fairly standard. It merely uncludes some defaults for the script to work with, as well as set's default zoom levels.
