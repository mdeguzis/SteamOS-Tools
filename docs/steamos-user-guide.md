# Steam Deck Guide

## Primer

* Basic usage: https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/69E3-14AF-9764-4C28
* What is Proton?: https://gamerant.com/steam-deck-how-to-use-the-proton-compatibility-features/. Allows you to run non-Linux native games, works super well nowadays.
* Like Retro gaming? Install EmuDeck: https://www.emudeck.com/
* Heroic: https://heroicgameslauncher.com/
* Look for some fun accessories. My favorite is from https://jsaux.com/collections/steam-deck-accessories. 

## Decky Loader stuff

https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz (yes, I have tried them ALL)

* AutoFlatpaks:  allows you to install while in game mode, very convenient.  
* CSS Loader can be iffy with performance, and I generally avoid it, but fun to play with
* ProtonDB Badges: must have, easy access to ProtonDB from games that exist in https://steamdb.info/. Helps with tips on running games, performance reports etc..
* Bluetooth: Very useful for quick access to headsets etc..
* HLTB for Deck: Good for fun stats on beating the game
* SteamGridDB: Must have, fill in missing artwork for different areas of the game info pages/views, alternate artwork
* Volume Mixer: Super nice to keep Steam button noise lower, so games can be full volume
* Decky Recorder: Record games, but now that non-beta has game recording and sharing features, not as useful
* Quick Launch: Useful for creating shortcuts from game mode for non-steam games/apps
* Web Browser: Kinda-sorta-better browser, but still limited like the Steam browser
* Decky Terminal: If you're a Linux nerd
* Wine Cellar: SUPER useful for managing Proton/Wine versions (which you'll find you need/want for the non-Linux native games. For the most part Proton Experiemental will work fine
* Brightness Bar: Visual bar for up/down brigh
* tness
